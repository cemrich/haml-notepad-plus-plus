======================

Basic Haml syntax highlighting for the Notepad++ editor.

## How to use
Open notepad++ and open the language panel by selecting *"Languages > Define own language..."*. Now you can click *"import"* and select the *haml.xml* file. You don't need to restart the editor - just reopen any opened haml files to see the syntax highlighting in action.
